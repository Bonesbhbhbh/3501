Code by Josie Barber and El Anderson

Questions:
1.the number of lines output by the code is n factorial (n!)
    for the first line in the string there is n options and 
    the second has n-1 options and 
    third has n-2 options and so forth
    so for n = 3 it could be this pattern would be represented as 3 * 2 * 1 or 3!

2. We used El's computer to do this math witch has a processing speed of 2000Mhz
and used the equation for estimates of (constant*O(n))/processing speed
